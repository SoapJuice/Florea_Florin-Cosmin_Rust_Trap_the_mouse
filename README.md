# Rust_Trap_the_mouse
Implement the Trap The Mouse game. The game will be split in two:
    a server which hosts the game. The user can create rooms where they wait for other players. When another player joins, the game starts for both players.
    a client which has a GUI where the user can connect to a room and play the game.
The client also has the possibility to play with the computer. In this case, it still has to connect to the server, and the server is the one that dictates the moves of the mouse.
The original game is found here:
